            Hello! This is Joe! Nice meeting you. I was born and raised in Taiwan before my college life. in my 18-year-old, I immigrated to California and started a new life.<br/>
            When I got enroll a college, I chose to be an Aggie (UC Davis). It is not because of that I like the place; in fact, the city of Davis is kind of boring and remote.
